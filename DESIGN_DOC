Regional History
	People need water to survive, so we're building aqueducts. It takes a long time to get the stone to build the aqueducts so they only have a limited supply. 
	
Quest Story
	Build an aqueduct to a city using a limited amount of supplies. Other villages will give you some supplies if the water can also get to them because water is awesome.

Level Design
	

General Level Overview
	There is a water source on the far left of the play field and a city on the right. There is a strip with no villages running down the center, but there might be obstacles in it. There are villages scattered around randomly above and below this strip.
