\cf0 	This is Aqueduct the Game. The goal of this game is to provide water to the city. The only source of water available is a lake, so you'll have to build an aqueduct to get the water there. You only have a limited amount of supplies to build the aqueduct, so you have to build carefully. You can stop by at the villages in the area and trade access to the water for more supplies. Not every village has the same amount of supplies available to offer you, so you will have to balance risk and reward when you go off the shortest route.}
