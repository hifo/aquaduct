Features:

Bugs:

- When a village is included in the aquaduct path, the code to determine which piece is drawn is incorrect (picture enclosed)
- Aquaduct can be placed in villages if two villages are directly adjacent (picture enclosed)
- Game ends early (i believe the aqueduct piece count is added AFTER adding the piece next to a village)
- Game over screen does not go away but next round starts

	- villages
